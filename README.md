# Predicting Property Prices in a Specific Location Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
The real estate market is complex, and influenced by numerous factors. This capstone project focuses on predicting property prices in a specific location using machine learning techniques. The aim is to provide valuable insights for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Gather and preprocess real estate data.
2. **Ordinal and Nominal Handling:** Handle ordinal and nominal columns separately for improved prediction accuracy.
3. **Data Preprocessing Techniques:** Implement scaling, PCA, and fillna() to handle missing data effectively.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify key variables influencing property prices through EDA.
5. **Encoding Techniques:** Determine suitable encoding methods for ordinal and nominal variables.
6. **Model Development:** Build a machine learning model for property price prediction.
7. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance and compare with alternative algorithms.
8. **Presentation:** Present project findings and insights clearly and concisely.

## Report on EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. This section presents key findings accompanied by graphs and visualizations.

1. **Distribution of Property Prices:** Histograms and boxplots reveal price distributions and identify outliers.
2. **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmaps and scatterplots explore relationships between property prices and numerical variables.
3. **Categorical Variables Analysis:** Bar charts and boxplots examine the distribution of categorical variables in relation to property prices.
4. **Time Trends Analysis:** Line plots analyze trends in property prices over time.
5. **Feature Engineering Insights:** Explore newly created features and their relationship with property prices.

## Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Understanding of feature engineering methods to enhance model performance.
- Familiarity with various machine learning algorithms and their application.
- Skills in model evaluation and comparison.
- Experience in presenting project findings effectively.

## Conclusion
This capstone project aims to develop a robust machine-learning model for predicting property prices in a specific location. By following a structured methodology encompassing data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and evaluation, the project aims to deliver accurate predictions and valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.
